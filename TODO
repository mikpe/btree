* sometimes delete writes an empty E before deleting that page,
  is that a bug?
* specialize search for membership test (avoid consing up the path)
* check if using maps instead of tuples would be beneficial:
  - check size of external representation
  - check cost of binary_to_term/term_to_binary of maps
  - problem: splitting maps is more expensive than splitting tuples
