* deletes sometimes write repeatedly to the same page, and sometimes
  write before delete of some pages; add cache to avoid redundant I/O
  (it should be delete-specific, insert doesn't need it)
* store data in top-level B-tree object without indirecting to root page;
  helps keeping data for small embedded B-trees directly in enclosing objects;
  insertion is easy to adjust, but not deletion; deletion in this case would
  be helped by the cache
* sometimes delete writes an empty E before deleting that page,
  is that a bug?
* specialize search for membership test (avoid consing up the path)
* add randomized testing (e.g. proper)
* check if using maps instead of tuples would be beneficial:
  - check size of external representation
  - check cost of binary_to_term/term_to_binary of maps
  - problem: splitting maps is more expensive than splitting tuples
